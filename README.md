JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

 In this project titled, "Wake up, sheeple!" you will find a file titled index.html which you can load into your IDE to connect to your local host and launch a web page that will allow you to enter a date in order to access eye-witness reports of extra-terrestrial activity collected by "ALIENS-R-REAL."

 An app.js file contains the JavaScript code which created the table, utilized event listeners, filtered through the dataset, and provided the appropriate data based upon the entered date. 

 Within the static folder you will find the data within data.js; alos style.css, nasa.jpg, and ufo.svg files that provided effects for the site.
